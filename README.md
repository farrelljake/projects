 Some scripts for analysing language data as well as utility scripts
 
 -- morphAnalyser.py: test script for handling morphologically rich languages. With a supplied XML lexicon, it analyses substrings to identify possible prefixes, stems, and suffixes. Future goals are to design a set of modular filters on substrings to handle language-specific factors + most probable analysis based on results

-- portmanteauGen.py: in progress script to generate portmanteaus that obey English phonotactics, using the CMU dictionary and a G2P library

-- dijkstra.py: dijkstra's algorithm (plus bidirectional version) 

-- quickXOR.py: a neat speed-up for XORing sequential runs of numbers

-- textGen.py: a simple script for generating text based off of ngrams

-- ngrams.py: calculates ngrams, surprisal etc
