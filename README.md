 Some scripts for analysing language data as well as utility scripts
 
 -- morphAnalyser.py: test script for handling morphologically rich languages. With a supplied XML lexicon, it analyses substrings to identify possible prefixes, stems, and suffixes. Future goals are to design a set of modular filters on substrings to handle language-specific factors + most probable analysis based on results
